 # Final Capstone Project: Task Manager

*This application is designed for a small business to help it manage tasks assigned to each member of a team by Admin.*

The Task Manager Program is written in the Python and lists, dictionaries, control structures, error handling and functions are used to extend
the functionality of the task management system. 

This project was assigned as part of the Hyperion Dev Software Engineering Bootcamp with the aim to assess bootcamp
student's ability to refactor code and improve functionality of the Task Manager Program.  


**What the program can do**


The following functions have been set up:

- register a user

- add a task

- view all tasks

- view my tasks

- generate reports

- display statistics

- exit


Admin is given the additional functionality to register users, display statistics  and generate reports.  The generate reports function generates txt files containing:
- the task overview report for all assigned tasks.
- the user overview report which shows statistics about the percentage of tasks completed, incomplete and overdue for each user.

The users can log in, view their tasks and assign tasks to themselves, edit tasks so that their task can be assigned to another user,
edit the task due date and mark tasks complete.

**Contributors**

This program was carried out by myself as part of the Sofware Engineering Bootcamp task.  During the Bootcamp, the mentors provided tutorials
that taught me about Lists, Dictionaries, Control structures, Functions, Defensive programming, ensuring best practices and Input and Output operations.
I am thankful to all of the mentors for their guidance, knowledge, time and expertise throughout the bootcamp.
